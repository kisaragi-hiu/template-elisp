# Emacs Lisp project template

1. `npx degit kisaragi-hiu/template-elisp`
2. Rename `pkgname.el` and definitions inside to the real package name
3. Replace license and license header with what you're actually using

Also see <https://gitlab.com/kisaragi-hiu/tst.el>, which uses ERT and ert-runner instead of buttercup, and GitLab CI instead of GitHub Actions.
